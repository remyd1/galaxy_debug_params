Galaxy Debug and Parameters plugin
----------------------------------

##### From Aurélien Bernard and Rémy Dernat
[ISE-M institute, Montpellier][1]


This code allow you to add two things in your menu. As an administrator you can debug all histories by displaying all parameters used by your users.
You could see the exact command line used by system to run the program.


As a user you could do exactly the same thing but only on your histories.

To install it, just run:


```bash
$ bash galaxy_plugin_installer.sh -d /path/to/galaxy-dir
```
